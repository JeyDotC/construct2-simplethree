## Overview

SimpleThree is a series of add-ons for Construct 2 that will allow you to render your regular layout in 3D using ThreeJs (hence the name). It is intended mostly for Doom-like or Top-Down perspectives.

> **Note:** This is not a full-fledged 3D solution, is just a way to display regular Construct 2 objects in a 3D environment.
